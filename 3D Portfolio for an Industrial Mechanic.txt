This is a fantastic pivot. A **3D Portfolio for an Industrial Mechanic** is incredibly unique and will stand out immediately to supervisors at Niagara.

Most mechanics just hand in a paper resume. You are going to hand them a **3D Interactive Production Line**.

We will keep the **"Modern Hybrid"** architecture (Liquid 3D Text) because it's efficient, but we will completely re-skin it to look **Industrial, Metallic, and Niagara-branded**.

Here is your tailored **"Krones Shift Mechanic" Portfolio Guide**.

-----

# Guide: The "Krones Line" Industrial Portfolio

**Goal:** Create a site that feels like a high-tech machine interface.
**Visual Theme:** "Niagara Blue" liquid metal, industrial greys, and clean manufacturing typography.
**Content:** Focus strictly on the Krones line (Blower → Palletizer).

## Phase 1: The "Niagara Blue" 3D Hero

We need to change the purple "Space" text to a "Water/Industrial" look.

**Action:** Update `src/components/Hero3D.jsx`.
Change the `color` in the material to Niagara's corporate blue (`#00a3e0`) or a metallic silver (`#cfcfcf`).

**Code Update (`src/components/Hero3D.jsx`):**

```jsx
// ... (imports remain the same)

<Text3D
  font="/fonts/helvetiker_bold.typeface.json"
  size={1.2}
  // ... (other settings remain the same)
>
  {/* CHANGE 1: Update Text to your Title */}
  NIAGARA MECHANIC
  
  {/* CHANGE 2: Update Material to "Water/Metal" */}
  <MeshDistortMaterial
    color="#00a3e0"   // Niagara Blue
    envMapIntensity={1} // High reflection (Shiny like steel)
    clearcoat={1}       // Wet look (Water bottles)
    metalness={0.5}     // Semi-metallic
    roughness={0.1}     // Very smooth
    speed={3}           // Fast moving liquid
    distort={0.4}
  />
</Text3D>
```

## Phase 2: The "Production Line" (Your Experience)

This is the most important part. We need to replace the default "Web Developer" experience with your actual Krones machinery training.

**Action:** Open `src/constants/index.js`.
**Task:** Replace the `experiences` array with your specific machine training.

**Code Update (`src/constants/index.js`):**

```javascript
// REPLACE the existing 'experiences' array with this:

export const experiences = [
  {
    title: "Blow Molder Specialist",
    company_name: "Krones Contiform",
    icon: "krones", // We will fix icons in Phase 4
    iconBg: "#E6DEDD", // Light grey industrial background
    date: "Machine #1 - The Start",
    points: [
      "Mastery of preform heating profiles and stretching rods.",
      "Troubleshooting high-pressure air faults and mold changeovers.",
      "Ensuring bottle integrity and dimensional stability before filling.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Filler & Capper Operator",
    company_name: "Krones Modulfill",
    icon: "niagara",
    iconBg: "#383E56", // Dark blue industrial background
    date: "Machine #2 - Critical Control",
    points: [
      "Managing volumetric filling valves and flow meters.",
      "Troubleshooting cap feeder jams and torque heads.",
      "Maintaining sterile conditions and CIP (Clean-in-Place) protocols.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Labeler Mechanic",
    company_name: "Krones Contiroll",
    icon: "krones",
    iconBg: "#E6DEDD",
    date: "Machine #3 - High Speed",
    points: [
      "Precision alignment of vacuum cylinders and cutting drums.",
      "Troubleshooting hot melt glue application and label transfer.",
      "Optimizing timing screws for high-speed bottle handling.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Packer & Palletizer",
    company_name: "Krones Variopac / Modulpal",
    icon: "niagara",
    iconBg: "#383E56",
    date: "Machine #4 - End of Line",
    points: [
      "Servicing robotic arms and layer formation tables.",
      "Troubleshooting film wrapping tension and heat tunnels.",
      "Maintaining chain conveyors and servo-motor synchronization.",
    ],
  },
];
```

-----

## Phase 3: The "Toolbox" (Your Tech Stack)

You are a mechanic, not a coder. Your "Tech Stack" isn't HTML/CSS; it's your tools and skills.

**Action:** Still in `src/constants/index.js`.
**Task:** Replace `technologies` with your mechanical skills.

**Code Update:**

```javascript
// REPLACE the existing 'technologies' array with this:

export const technologies = [
  {
    name: "Hydraulics",
    icon: "hydraulics", // You will need to find icons for these
  },
  {
    name: "Pneumatics",
    icon: "pneumatics",
  },
  {
    name: "Schematics",
    icon: "schematics",
  },
  {
    name: "PLC Logic",
    icon: "plc",
  },
  {
    name: "LOTO Safety",
    icon: "safety",
  },
  {
    name: "Multi-meter",
    icon: "multimeter",
  },
];
```

-----

## Phase 4: Getting the Icons

The code above references icons like `"krones"`, `"hydraulics"`, etc. You need to download images for these.

1.  **Find Images:** Go to Google Images and search for "Hydraulic Icon PNG", "Gear Icon PNG", "Krones Logo PNG".
2.  **Save Them:** Save them into your project folder at `src/assets/`.
3.  **Import Them:** Open `src/assets/index.js` and register them.

**Code Update (`src/assets/index.js`):**

```javascript
// Add these lines to the top
import krones from "./krones.png";
import niagara from "./niagara.png";
import hydraulics from "./hydraulics.png";
// ... import the rest

// Add them to the export list
export {
  // ... existing exports
  krones,
  niagara,
  hydraulics,
};
```

## Summary of the Mechanic Build

1.  **Hero:** "Niagara Blue" Liquid Metal text.
2.  **Experience:** Timeline of the entire bottle journey (Blower -\> Palletizer).
3.  **Skills:** Floating 3D balls that show gears, wrenches, and electrical symbols instead of coding logos.

This will look incredible. Would you like me to help you find a specific **3D icon** (like a gear or wrench) to replace the floating balls in the "Tech" section later?
