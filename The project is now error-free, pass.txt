The project is now error-free, passing all checks and building successfully, with only a non-critical chunk size warning remaining. To personalize this 3D website, you'll need to update content in src/constants/index.js src/components/Hero.jsx, src/components/About.jsx, and other relevant components with your information. For 3D assets, replace placeholder geometries in src/components/canvas/Computers.jsx and src/components/canvas/Earth.jsx with your own models using useGLTF from @react-three/drei, placing media in src/assets. Styling can be customized in src/index.css, tailwind.config.cjs, and src/styles.js. Finally, for the contact form in src/components/Contact.jsx, integrate a service like EmailJS to enable functionality. By following these steps, you can tailor this template into your unique personal 3D website.
